[CHRISSIE: ]  You've been crying your face is a mess   Come in baby, you can wipe the tears on my dress   She's hurt you again, I can tell   I know that look so well       [ALI:]    Don't be shy, we've been here before   Pull your shoes off,   And I will lock the door   And no-one has to know, I've come here again   Knowing it'll be like it's always been before       (CHORUS)    [CHRISSIE & ALI:]    Breakfast In Bed, Kisses For Me   You don't have to say you love me   Breakfast in bed, love can make you sing       [CHRISSIE:]    What's your hurry, please don't hit and run   We can let her wait, my darling its been so long       [ALI: ]   Since you've had me here, I've returned again   Darling it will be like it's always been before       [REPEAT CHORUS AND FADE]
