I remember holdin' on to you All them long and lonely nights I put you through Somewhere in there I'm sure I made you cry But I can't remember if we said goodbye  But I recall all of them nights down in Mexico One place I may never go in my life again Was I just off somewhere just too high But I can't remember if we said goodbye  I only miss you here every now and then Like the soft breeze blowin up from the Carribean Most Novembers I break down and cry But I can't remember if we said goodbye
