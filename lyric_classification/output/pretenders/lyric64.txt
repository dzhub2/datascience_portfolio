If There Was a Man Performed by Chrissie Hynde & The Pretenders If there was a man I could dream of, I'd dream about a dream come true. If there was a man I could ever love, I'd wait a million years for someone just like you. All my life I've been belated. Never taking any chances...always hesitating. Where's the payoff? Where's the glory? Where's the one I'm holding out for? Was he walking through the door, The one that you walked through...if it isn`t you? If there was a man I could dream of, I'd dream about a dream come true. If there was a man I could ever love, I'd wait a million years for someone just like you. Happy endings never find me! I'd put all my fantasies and hopes of love behind me. All my moments overdue but... If there was a man out there for me I wish it would be someone who could love me true If someone was you.
