Lovers of today unlike lovers of the past They used to find a way to get a love affair to last I saw him leaving that's is all I have to see and seeing is believing then  [Chorus] Love's a mystery It's a mystery It'll rise without a warning leaving evidence and clues It can headlines in the morning Then is history Love's a mystery But I'll do it again I'll do it again  Lovers of today are becoming too diversed Get the feeling you are onstage, badly unrehearsed Have the molds done so perfectly I guess all it proofs  [Chorus] Love's a mystery Love's a mystery It'll rise without a warning Making evidence or clues Making headlines in the morning Then is history But I'll do it again I'll do it again  The multiple offender should learn from his mistakes I am ready to surrender That is what it takes I waited a time Still in custody If love needs a crime  [Chorus] Love's a mystery But I'll do it again I'll do it again It will rise without a warning Leaving evidence and clues Headlines in the morning Then is history Love's a mystery  Love's a mystery
