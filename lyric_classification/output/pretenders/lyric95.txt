He doesn't Make Shoes Or Design a New Shirt Or Take Photographs But no one gets hurts And he doesn't look Trendy Like guys in Magazines You won't see him at parties He's not the Face behind the scene.  [Chorus] He Makes Nothing He's the Nothing Maker He's the Maker of Nothing He's the Nothing Maker  And he doesn't paint pictures Or Write poetry Or act on a stage For others to see and he don't expect much Santa Claus knows Cause he doesn't make list Of toys and new clothes.  [Chorus]  [Bridge] Everyone's Chasing A reason to live Mostly they take more than they give The Succeeder Justifies Why he's better than the rest He believes his own lies And thinks he's the best... ... but my guy  Doesn't make Movies To suit an audience's whim He lives by a code Known only to him And eh doesn't make money to Buy watches and cars Cause there's no time and no place to go For a man who has nothing to show  [Chorus]
