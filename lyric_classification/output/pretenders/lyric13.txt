I don't expect flowers I don't expect rings I don't expect promises A sentimental thing  I just expect you To be the man you are I just expect you To be the man you are  I don't expect sobriety I don't expect stealth I don't expect you'll ever be a man Defined by your wealth  I just expect you To be the man you are I just expect you To be the man you are  When a woman loves a man She'll do anything he asks She'll do anything she can When a woman loves a man  I don't expect accolades I don't expect prizes I don't expect you'll ever see a babe In different guises  I just expect you To be the man you are I just expect you To be the man you are To be the man you are Be the man you are Be the man you are Be the man you are Be the man you are
