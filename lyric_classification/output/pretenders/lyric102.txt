If it's games you want I've played a few Let me say up front I'll lose to you I can see you're a beginner Well beginner's luck runs out You think you're a winner But let me tell ya The winning's not what it's all about You see, it's about the losing Can't rest until I'm losing  At first you feel hungry Then you're thirsty too Then a desperate feeling comes over you You think you can beat What no one has before Then you start to cheat Before you know it You're back for more  You see it's about the losing  Can't stop when I'm at the top It's about the losing Every time I win I have to start again Can't rest, rest until I'm losing A bluff's about as good as the getting will get You see in this neighborhood We're all in debt  A little more money A little more fame Who amongst us, if anybody Wouldn't risk it all To stay in the game You see it's about the losing Can't stop when I'm at the top It's about the losing Every time I win I have to start again  Can't rest, rest until I'm losing Can't rest, rest until I'm losing Can't rest, rest until I'm losing It's about the losing It's about the losing It's about the losing
