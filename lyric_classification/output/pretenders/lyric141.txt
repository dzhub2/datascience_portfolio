Standing on a rooftop Overlooking a park Eyes are glowing In the dark  The smell of horses lingers in the air It feels like something else is out there  Maybe love is in New York City Fluorescent streets might lead me to it I've been to Barcelona, Lima, and Hong Kong If it was here, I never knew it If it was here all along  The clouds are low And cast a misty spell As if they've got A story to tell  A constellation overhead A cross like an ancient gift Something led me here  Maybe love is in New York City Fluorescent streets might lead me to it I've been to Barcelona, Lima, and Hong Kong If it was here, I never knew it If it was here all along  Is it ever too late? To do what's never been done Things change and they're never quite the same For anyone  Never understandin' But now that people told me This city owns its own mess Like arms still hold me  I just heard traffic rushin' past Everything goin', goin' too fast Everything goin', goin' too fast  Maybe love is in New York City Fluorescent streets might lead me to it I've been to Barcelona, Lima, and Hong Kong If it was here, I never knew it If it was here all along
