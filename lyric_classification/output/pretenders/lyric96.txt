Don't lose faith in me Don't lose faith in me If you lose faith in me You lose faith in us  Don't lose harmony Don't lose harmony If you lose harmony You won't need me  Look at me Can you see how I'm trying Only you can see me crying Look at me These tears ain't lying  One pays the butcher One pays the thief I'm looking for you darling Show me some relief Artist on the cover Is a phony and a crook I'm looking for you lover Show me where to look  Don't lose faith in me Please don't lose faith in me If you lose faith You lose faith in us
