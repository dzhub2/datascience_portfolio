A very precious love Is what you are to me A stairway to a star A night in Shangri-La Of ecstasy  Lanterns of gold Lanterns of blue Twinkle in the shadows While I dance with you  An echo in the wind (An echo in the wind) Across the summer lake (Across the summer lake)  Is saying you should know That lanterns lose their glow And hearts can break (And hearts can break)  So hold me close, my darling Then kiss me tenderly And give your precious love Your very precious love to me  So hold me close, my darling Then kiss me tenderly And give your precious love Your very precious love to me (My very precious love)
