Well, I didn't wanna be this lonely Though losing you was a relief From a life with one man only Devoid of morals or belief  But I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely  I'm still not sure I did the right thing To forfeit danger for good sense But in my mind, you're like a cash till Breaking dollars into cents  But I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely  Hey Hey Lo-lo-lonely Hey Hey Lonely  You'll find somebody else to suffer And get to know your selfish ways And I'll feel pity for the next one When you start to ruin her days But I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely No, I didn't wanna be this lonely
