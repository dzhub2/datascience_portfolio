This is a mercy mission From a faceless messenger Who don't wanna see you hit Here's the word, oh, listen to it  Somebody that you used to know Is back in town you better go  This is a mercy mission A voice you'll never hear again From a southside call box Oh, winged demons are the hardest to outfox  The same one you lost on the run Gonna show you that it ain't no fun  You better get out of town 'Cause you're gonna get hit I didn't wanna see you fail  This is a mercy mission You'll find your schedule underneath the door All of the arrangements have been made Major expenses have been paid as you know  Don't forget the last details Accept no parcels in the mail
