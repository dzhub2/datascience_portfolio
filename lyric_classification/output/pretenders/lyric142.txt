Crying in public's an unfortunate thing A woman in love is a delicate thing And a woman who's sad for no reason at all Will be crying in public, in the car, or the mall Crying in public, crying in public  She's on the train, alone there, she sits Sobbing her heart out, falling to bits On a park bench on a sunny day When a woman's distressed, you best look away If she's crying in public, crying in public  Feminists claim that we're all the same But I don't know a man who's felt the same shame  She might look a million or only ten cents When mascara runs, there's no recompense Aristocrat, popper, or the bourgeoisie All know what it feels like when life's misery Means crying in public, crying in public  Knowing that everyone sees it revealed When the heartstrings are pulling you into a field You run through the cornrows and find nowhere to hide Then all of a sudden it bursts from inside And you're crying in public, crying in public Crying in public, crying in public Crying in public, crying in public
