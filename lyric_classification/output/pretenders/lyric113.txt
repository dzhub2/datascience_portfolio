She ...  She came from the land of the cotton  A land that was nearly forgotten  By everyone  And she ...  She worked and she slaved so hard  A big ol' field was her backyard  In the delta sun  Oh, but she sure could sing  Yes, yes  She sure could sing   Then he ...  Looked down and he took a little pity  The whole town swore he decided  He help her some  And he  Didn't mind if she wasn't very pretty  For deep inside his heart he knew  She was the only one  Oh, but she sure could sing  My, my she sure could sing  She had faith and she had believin'  She led all the people together in singin'  And she prayed very night  To the Lord up above  Singin' hallelujah  Oh, hallelujah   They ...  Would walk singin' songs by the river  Even when she knew for sure  She had to go away  And she  Never knew what her life had to give her  And never had to worry about it  For one single day  Oh, but she sure could sing  Yes, yes she sure could sing
