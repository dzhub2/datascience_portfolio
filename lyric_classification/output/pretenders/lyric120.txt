I wish I was someone else I'm confused, I'm afraid, I hate the loneliness And there's nowhere to run to nothing makes any sense, but I still try my hardest Take my hand please help me man 'cause I'm looking for something to believe in And I don't know where to start and I don't know where to begin, to begin If I was stupid or naive trying to achieve what they all call contentedness If people weren't such dicks and I never made mistakes then I could find forgiveness Take my hand please help me man 'cause I'm looking for something to believe in  And I don't know where to start and I don't know where to begin, oh no I can't be someone else I don't feel that it's hopeless I don't feel that I'm useless I can't throw it all away I need some courage to find my weakness And with your love, I know with all my heart I can win 'cause I'm looking for something to believe in and I just need something to believe in I'm looking for something to believe in and I just need something to believe in.
