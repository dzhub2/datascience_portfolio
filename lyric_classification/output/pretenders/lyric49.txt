They're just millionaires They got the money, but who cares? They'll never be like you and me Cause money can't buy poverty They think they govern our affairs They're just millionaires!  When they pass us in their cars They look at us like we're from Mars Those distant eyes look sympathetic We slash their tires cause we're pathetic And we get paid for the repairs By the millionaires!  They're just millionaires They got the money They got the money yeah! They're just millionaires They got the money child They got the money yeah! They're just millionaires They got the money child They got the money child yeah!  If they'd just leave us in their will We'd all be dressed to kill And burn our polyester flares With the millionaires!
