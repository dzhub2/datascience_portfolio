[Chorus:] I'm a very very complex person I try to improve but you see how I worsen I'll do anything to make you adore me Or deplore me, but never ignore me  I got senses that I cannot control My stomach's like a bottomless hole My desires command me like a slave I'm a knave, I can hardly behave  [Chorus]  I'm a peacenik but I'm going off to war I couldn't even tell you what I'm really fighting for It seems right; at least it doesn't seem wrong I'm a mixed-up, fucked-up singer of a song  [Chorus]  I refuse to keep a gun in my purse Imagine if I was feeling perverse The builders and the workers when they whistle and they shout I'd like to give them something to shout at me about  [Chorus]  I'm a very very complex person I'm a very very complex person  Anyway I got a plan to give it all away I won't need a suitcase on judgment day I'm a very very complex person...
