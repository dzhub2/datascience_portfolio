I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself For being jealous I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself For thing that you can't see  I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself For using other fellows To blindside you to get inside of me  Believe me I'm not saying that I'm proud To undermine and sabotage your scene I wouldn't want to say some things out loud But everybody does it and you know what I mean  I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself For backing the wrong horse I hate myself, I hate myself I hate my masquerade of black and blue  I hate myself, I hate my reckless  And self-destruction course And coming last conceding second best to you  And if on judgement day I'm told to make my way To take a blasting residence downstairs I look to see your fathers, who back stab their own brothers Got a lighter sentence showing mercy and repentance  I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself I guess I'm just too smart I hate myself, I hate myself, I hate myself In body and in mind  I hate myself, I hate myself I hate these perversions of the heart I hate myself up front I hate myself from behind  So take my hand To the witness stand I deserve the worst My heart is gonna burst So validate me hate me where it hurts  I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself  I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself I hope that you do too  I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself I hate myself But most of all I hate myself Hating you
