So much for banning the bomb The president's wife is carrying a hand gun If you want blood sports for fun now They call me "the hunter" - better run now You hear a "crack" in the distance, baby Your phony mating calls resistance maybe Don't smile; we're gonna get you We'll have your rifle off you too Gimme a kiss And hold a candle to this!  Foxy lady dressed to kill You say you won't, but you will What's on your face and your breath, mama? You wear your glory of death, mama But liberation's on the way Every dog's gonna have it's day Pack up your rape racks and crush box out of Hell Farmer in the dell Oh, please, I insist Hold a candle to this!  Bring on the ecstasy And the bliss Bring on my wedding day And everybody's birthday Blow up the abattoir! Detonate! We're going home Where the buffalo roam!

(You're American, miss) Hold a candle to this!
