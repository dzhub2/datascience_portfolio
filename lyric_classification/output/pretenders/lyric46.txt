I drank tequila 'cause I can't have your lips tonight  I don't want to feel ya I don't want to feel sad tonight  You make me suffer and you just don't know  Estoy barrochos down in New Mexico  I want to remember but I try to forget  That scene in the car park that I still regret  Just like before, times I've even lost track  I ran away crawling 'cause I fall every time I look back  Miles, baby, hundreds of highways and truck stops I've used  Cars, baby, hundreds of cars have passed and refused  I stood on the shoulder with tears in my eyes  I drank tequila and watched the game in the bar  I don' t care who loses, I don't know who the teams are  We had our time, but the bell's finally tolled  My Ohio winter was finally too cold
