Look at me Funny face That's not you A wrinkled nose A tear You're crying  Oh Rest your head Cry on me Don't be afraid I'll stay with you I know you'll make it And you'll make it good [Repeat: x3]  All of my life I haven't known much All I know Is what I feel And what I feel And what I feel Love I'm in love Love Love
