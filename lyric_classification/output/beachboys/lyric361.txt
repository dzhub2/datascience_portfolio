You got me calling at all hours of the night I don't think it's right But still i do it  You got me thinking your existence is my life It's time to see the light I think i'll leave it  Maybe, i don't know I tried to take it slow But i don't know Maybe, i don't know But if you say it's so We can make it go Maybe, i don't know  Whatever made me think that we could make it good?
