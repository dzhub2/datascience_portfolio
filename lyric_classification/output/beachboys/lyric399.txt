I should have known better with a girl like you,  That I would love everything that you do; and I do,  Hey, hey, hey, and I do.   Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be,  This could only happen to me Can't you see, can't you see  That when I tell you that I love you, oh,  You're gonna say you love me too,  Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh  And when I ask you to be mine,  You're gonna say you love me too.  You love me too, you love me too.
