Heart and soul, I fell in love with you Heart and soul, the way a fool would do, madly Because you held me tight And stole a kiss in the night  Heart and soul, I begged to be adored Lost control, and tumbled overboard, gladly That magic night we kissed There in the moon mist  Oh, but your lips were thrilling, much too thrilling Never before were mine so strangely willing  But now I see, what one embrace can do Look at me, it's got me loving you madly That little kiss you stole Held all my heart and soul
