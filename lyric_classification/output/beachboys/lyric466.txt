Give me the world and I will turn it down Can't think of anything I need No cigarette's, no sleep, no light, no sound Nothing to eat, no books to read  Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe And to love you All I need is the air that I breathe And to love you  All I need is the air that I breathe Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak Sleep, silent angel, go to sleep  Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe And to love you All I need is the air that I breathe And to love you All I need is the air that I breathe  Peace came upon me and it leaves me weak Sleep, silent angel, go to sleep Making love with you Has left me peaceful and warm and tired What more could I ask There's nothing left to be desired  Sometimes all I need is the air that I breathe And to love you All I need is the air that I breathe And to love you All I need is the air that I breathe And to love you All I need is the air that I breathe
