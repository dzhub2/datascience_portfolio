There's a world where I can go And tell my secrets to In my room In my room  In this world I lock out All my worries and my fears In my room In my room  Do my dreaming and my scheming lie awake and pray Do my crying and my sighing laugh at yesterday  Now it's dark and I'm alone But I won't be afraid In my room In my room
