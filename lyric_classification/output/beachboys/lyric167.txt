Why do fools fall in love?  Why do birds sing so gay And lovers await the break of day Why do they fall in love  Why does the rain fall from up above Why do fools fall in love Why do they fall in love  Love is a losing game Love can be a shame I know of a fool you see That fool is me  Why do fools fall in love?  Why do birds sing so gay And lovers await the break of day Why do they fall in love  Why does the rain fall from up above Why do fools fall in love Why do they fall in love  Why does my heart skip this crazy beat Because it knows It will reach defeat Tell me why, tell me why Why do fools fall in love?
