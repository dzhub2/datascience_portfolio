I should have known better with a girl like you That I would love everything that you do And I do, hey, hey, hey And I do  Oh, oh I should have realized what a kiss could be That this could only happen to me Can't you see? Can't you see?  That when I tell you that I love you, oh You're gonna say you love me too And when I ask you to be mine You're gonna say you love me too  You love me too You love me too You love me too
