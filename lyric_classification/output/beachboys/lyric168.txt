When I grow up to be a man Will I dig the same things that turn me on as a kid? Will I look back and say that I wish I hadn't done what I did? Will I joke around and still dig those sounds When I grow up to be a man?  Will I look for the same things in a woman that I dig in a girl? (Fourteen, fifteen) Will I settle down fast or will I first wanna travel the world? (Sixteen, seventeen) Now I'm young and free, but how will it be? When I grow up to be a man?  Will my kids be proud or think their old man is really a square? (Eighteen, nineteen) When they're out having fun yeah, will I still wanna have my share? (Twenty, twenty-one) Will I love my wife for the rest of my life? When I grow up to be a man?  What will I be when I grow up to be a man?  Won't last forever It's kind of sad Won't last forever It's kind of sad
