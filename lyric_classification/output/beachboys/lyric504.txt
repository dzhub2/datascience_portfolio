Driving around, living the dream I'm cruising the town, digging the scene I'm not gonna stress, not gonna worry Doing my best, no need to hurry  Looking ahead, with anticipation Making each day a new celebration Seems like it could go on forever Long as we can all stick together We used to get around, get up and hit up All the hot spots in town  Spring vacation Good vibration Summer weather We're back together Here's ya money Hey, not funny Hey what's it to ya,  Hallelujah!   That's with the past, it's all behind us We're happier now Look where love finds us Singing our songs is enough reason Harmony boys is what we believe in Some said it wouldn't last All we can say is we're still having a blast  Spring vacation Good vibration Summer weather We're back together Here's ya money Hey, not funny Hey what's it to ya,  Hallelujah!  Every night's a special occasion  Spring vacation Good vibration Summer weather We're back together Here's ya money Hey, not funny Hey what's it to ya,  Hallelujah!
