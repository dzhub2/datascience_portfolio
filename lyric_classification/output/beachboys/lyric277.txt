In Hawaii there's a place known as Waimea Bay Where the best surfers in the world come to stay And ride the wild surf they come to try To conquer those waves some 30 feet high  Ride ride ride the wild surf Ride ride ride the wild surf Ride ride ride the wild surf Gotta take that one last ride  Surf fever brings them here to meet the test And hanging round the beach you'll see the best They're waxed up and ready just waiting for The surf to build up on the northern shore  Lined up and waiting for that next big set outside Nothing can stop it cause you've just gotta ride ride ride ride ride The heavies at the pipeline are OK But they can't match the savage surf at Waimea Bay It takes a lot of skill and courage unknown To catch the last wave and ride it in alone Ride ride ride the wild surf Ride ride ride the wild surf Ride ride ride the wild surf Gotta take that one last Gotta take that one last ride
