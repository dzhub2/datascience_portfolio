On my way to sunny Californ-I-a On my way to spend another sunny day  Water, water get yourself in the cool, clear, water The sun shines brightly down on penny's place The sun shines brightly down on the bay The airs so clean it'll just take your mind away Take your mind away Take your mind away  Have you ever been south of Monterrey Barrancas carve the coast line and the chaparral flows to the sea Neath waves of golden sunshine And have you ever been north of morro bay The south coast plows the sea And the people there are of the breed They don't need electricity Water, water, cool cascades of clear, clear water The sun dance final scene sets the hills ablaze. Horizon edges quick up the mountains way.  Have you ever been down Salinas way? Where Steinbeck found the valley And he wrote about it the way it was in his travelings with Charley And have you ever walked down through the sycamores Where the farmhouse used to be There the monarchs autumn journey ends On a windswept Cyprus tree  Water get water get yourself in that Get yourself in that get yourself in that cool, clear, water The sun shines brightly down on penny's place Get yourself in that water The airs so clean that it just takes your mind away Take your mind away Take your mind away  Have you ever been to a festival, the big sure congregation? Where country Joe will do his show And he'd sing about liberty And the people there in the open air, one big family. Yeah the people there love to sing and share Their new found liberty
