Standin' on a mountain lookin' down on a city The way i feel is a doggone pity Teardrops fallin' down the mountainside Many times i've been here, many times i've cried We used to be so happy when we were in love High on a mountain of love  Night after night i'm a-standin' here alone Weepin' out my heart (*laugh*) till the cold grey dawn Prayin' that you're lonely and you'll come here too Hopin' just by chance that i'll get a glimpse of you (oh yeah!) Trying hard to find you somewhere up above High on a mountain of love  The mountain of love, the mountain of love You should be ashamed You used to be a mountain of love But you just changed your name  Way down below there's a half a million people Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers Wedding bells are ringin' and they should've been ours That's why i'm so handy, my dream is gone above High on a mountain of love  (keep playin' it like it is!)  High on a mountain of love The mountain of love, the mountain of love You should be ashamed You used to be a mountain of love But you just changed your name  Way down below there's a half a million people Somewhere there's a church with a big tall steeple Inside the church, there's an altar filled with flowers Wedding bells are ringin' and they should've been ours That's why i'm so lonely, my dream is gone above High on a mountain of love High on a mountain of love High on a mountain of love High on a mountain of love  (What, honey?) High on a mountain of love. (hahahaha.) Ooh baby... (That's good.) One more time. oooh baby. oooooo. (That's a good voice.)
