Do you remember back in old L.A. (Wo-oh-oh) When everybody drove a Chevrolet (Wo-oh-oh) Whatever happened to the boy next door, Suntanned, crewcut, all-American Male?  Remember dancing at the high school hop The dress I ruined with the soda pop? I barely recognized the girl next door With beatup sneakers and a pony tail  CHORUS: Beach Baby, Beach Baby, give me your hand Give me something that I can remember Just like before, we can walk by the shore in the moonlight.  Beach Baby, Beach Baby, there on the sand From July to the end of September Surfin' was fun, we'd be out in the sun every day.  Oooh. I never thought that it would end Oooh. And I was everybody's friend Long hot days, Blue sea haze Juke box plays, but now it's fading away.  We could'nt wait for graduation day We took my car and drove to San Jose That's where you told me that you'd wear my ring I guess you don't remember anything!  CHORUS Vocal Harmonies and Stylings Beach Baby, Beach Baby, Beach Baby ETC.
