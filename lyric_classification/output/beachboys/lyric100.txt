The night was black, rain fallin' down; Looked for my baby, she's nowhere around. Traced her footsteps down to the shore, 'Fraid she's gone forever more.        I looked at the sea and it seemed to say, "I took your baby from you away." I heard a voice cryin' in the deep, "Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep."  Why did we quarrel, why did we fight? Why did I leave her alone tonight? That's why her footsteps ran into the sea That's why my baby has gone from me. I looked at the sea and it seemed to say, "I took your baby from you away." I heard a voice cryin' in the deep, "Come join me baby in my Endless Sleep."  Ran in the water, heart full of fear, There in the breakers I saw her near; Reached for my darlin', held her to me, Stole her away from the angry sea. I looked at the sea and it seemed to say, "You took your baby from me away." My heart cried out, "She's mine to keep." I saved my baby from an Endless Sleep.
