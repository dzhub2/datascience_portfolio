 There's alot of things I want, a lot of things that I'd like to be. But girl, I don't forsee  a rags-to-riches story for me. There's just one little dream I've got to come true; There's just one round I've gotta win, I can't be a loser with you.   Baby, baby, Once In My Life, let me get what I want, Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life, let me hold on to one good thing I found! Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',   Cause I couldn't face a day if you weren't here by my side. If you went away then I'd be left without any pride. I've given up on schemes, 'Cause all of them fell through, I've given up so many things, Don't ask me to give up on you.   Baby, baby, Once In My Life, let me get what I want, Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life, let me hold on to one good thing I found! Don't let me down! Baby, say that you'll be stayin',   That old pot of gold ain't so easy to find, But if you stand by me, I'll keep my peace of mind. I can't give you the world, But I I'll work hard for you, girl. I'll work hard, ev'ryday, all my life.  So baby, please don't leave me, just do this for me.     Once In My Life, let me get what I want, Girl, don't let me down!  Just Once In My Life, let me hold on to one good thing I found! Don't let me down!  Baby, say that you'll be stayin'.  =
