Hanging down from my window Those are my wind chimes On the warm breeze the little bells Tinkle like wind chimes Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes Now and then a tear rolls off my cheek  Close your eyes and lean back now listen to wind chimes In the late afternoon you're hung up on wind chimes Though it's hard I try not to look at my wind chimes
