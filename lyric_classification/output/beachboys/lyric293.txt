 She's got stars in her eyes and knots on her knees, now her crazy grass shift really sways in the breeze now, Ridin' down a heavy or lyin' in the sand,  She's the hippest surfer girl in the land. And she's my Honolulu Lulu, She's my Honolulu Lulu. Queen of the surfer girls!   Well, she handles all the big ones ev'ry year of Macaha, and all the surfers know her form Rincon to Baya. When the beach is quiet and you know we're outa luck, we pray for surf while makin' out in our truck. Just me and Honolulu Lulu, Me and Honolulu Lulu. Queen of the surfer girls!   I tell you, Once upon a time,you know,  she got a little bold when she tried a hula spinner, But her wax wouldn't hold. (Whoops!)  Over the falls 'stead of hangin' ten, But then she'd paddle out and try it again. 'Cause she's my Honolulu Lulu, She's my Honolulu Lulu.
