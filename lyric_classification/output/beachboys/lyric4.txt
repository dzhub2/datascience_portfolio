Well its been building up inside of me For oh I don't know how long I don't know why But I keep thinking Something's bound to go wrong  But she looks in my eyes And makes me realize And she says "don't worry, baby" Don't worry, baby Don't worry, baby Everything will turn out alright  Don't worry, baby Don't worry, baby Don't worry, baby  I guess I should've kept my mouth shut When I started to brag about my car But I can't back down now I pushed the other guys too far  She makes me come alive And makes me want to drive When she says "don't worry, baby" Don't worry, baby Don't worry, baby Everything will turn out alright  Don't worry, baby Don't worry, baby Don't worry, baby  She told me "baby, when you race today Just take along my love with you And if you know how much I loved you Baby nothing could go wrong with you"  Oh what she does to me When she makes love to me And she says "don't worry, baby" Don't worry, baby Don't worry, baby Everything will turn out alright  Don't worry, baby Don't worry, baby Don't worry, baby
