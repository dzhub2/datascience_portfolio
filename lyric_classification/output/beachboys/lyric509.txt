We've been goin' steady now for such a long time And up until now, everything was just fine You say you still love me but it's not the same It so plain to see that you're playin' a game  You really know how to hurt a guy You really know how to make me cry You really know how to hurt a guy But what a mean way to say goodbye  Every time you hurt me, it seems like you planned it I've talked to your friends but they don't understand it Where did I lose it? What did I do wrong? We can't break it up now, it's lasted so long  If you'd look at me, you'd see tears in my eyes When we're together and you're lookin' at other guys The ones that you like are really not your kind I know their type and what's on their minds
