God of God, Light of Light, Lo! He abhors not the Virgin's womb; Very God, Begotten, not created.  [Refrain]  See how the shepherds Summoned to His cradle, Leaving their flocks, draw nigh to gaze! We, too, will thither Bend our hearts' oblations.  [Refrain]  Lo, star-led chieftains, Magi, Christ adoring, Offer Him incense, gold and myrrh; We to the Christ-child Bring our hearts' oblations  [Refrain]  Child, for us sinners, Poor and in the manger, Fain we embrace Thee with love and awe; Who would not love Thee, Loving us so dearly?  [Refrain]  Sing, choirs of angels, Sing in exultation, O sing, all ye citizens of heaven above! "Glory to God, In the highest!"  [Refrain]  Yea, Lord, we greet Thee, Born this happy morning, Jesus, to Thee be all glory given; Word of the Father, Now in flesh appearing!  [Refrain]
