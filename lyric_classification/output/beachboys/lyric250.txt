Hey adam, you'll never guess what i saw last night. What? I saw mommy kissing santa claus. that's right. Oh no. They were listening to music, and their voices were low, And he looks a lot like someone that you and i both know! Who? Well, i saw santa rockin' round the christmas tree And mama was as close to santa as you are to me They filled up the socks, But before he could go They started to kiss. Santa just couldn't go. Well, i saw mama help santa decorate the tree With little bitty presents and candy canes for you and me He started to leave... Mm! Then he turned around. I made a noise.  I was sure to be found! Well, i saw mama kissin' santa 'neath the mistletoe Yeah, and he looked like someone i thought you oughta know
