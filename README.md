## Animated Scatter Plot App

On this [website](https://dzhub2.pythonanywhere.com), I deployed an animated scatter plot app. [Here](https://github.com/dzhub2/datascience_portfolio/blob/master/population_dash_app/animated_scatter_by_population.ipynb) is the notebook version, which can be run locally without the website.

<ins>Methods:</ins> Plotly Express, Dash, Pandas

## Classification - Titanic Kaggle Competetion

[Here](https://github.com/dzhub2/datascience_portfolio/blob/master/kaggle_titanic/titanic_submission.ipynb), I built a Machine Learning classification model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. This project is part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview/description) and received a score of 0.78.

<ins>Methods:</ins> Feature Engineering, XGBoost

## Regression - Bike Sharing Kaggle Competetion

[Here](https://github.com/dzhub2/datascience_portfolio/blob/master/kaggle_bike_rental/bike_project.ipynb), I built several Machine Learning regression models to forecast the use of a city bikeshare system. This project is part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/overview) and received a score of 0.40 (Top 7%).

<ins>Methods:</ins> Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering, ML Regression Models

## Song Lyrics Predictor

[Here](https://github.com/dzhub2/datascience_portfolio/blob/master/lyric_classification/lyric_classification.ipynb), I implemented a web scrapper collecting song lyrics from different artists to build a Bag of Words NLP model. For any user input-sentence, the program predicts which artist most likely used this sentence in one of their lyrics.
