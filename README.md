## Animated Scatter Plot App

On this [website](https://dzhub2.pythonanywhere.com), I deployed an animated scatter plot app. [Here](https://github.com/dzhub2/datascience_portfolio/blob/master/population_dash_app/animated_scatter_by_population.ipynb) is the notebook version, which can be run locally without the website.
